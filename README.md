# Algorithmic-Problems2

These are some of the algorithmic problems I have solved.

Inside you will find the description and few sample input/output.

For the full input/output please visit https://judge.telerikacademy.com/problems and click About --> ProblemsInfo 

In some of the solution I am using a custom made input reader to optimize speed.Also some weird choices are possible because of speed(putting all output in StringBuilder and spitting it out at once etc).
